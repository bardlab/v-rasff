Currently mamanged by the <strong>E</strong>uropean <strong>F</strong>ood <strong>S</strong>afety <strong>A</strong>uthority (<a href=https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/rasff_en>EFSA</a>), it provides open access to the data, as well as the possibility to filter and export notifications through a <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=SearchForm&cleanSearch=1">dedicated Portal</a>. The EFSA itself regularly publishes reports detailing the contributions of European Countries to the notification system (that is how many notifications are issued by each EU country in Country Fact Sheets) and a yearly report.</p> <p class=svelte-3ocqwf>Despite its overall usefulness, these tools have shortcomings, namely: </p> <ul><li>the most interesting data (country of origin, specific nature of the alert, products affected), are buried within non-formatted, highly variable text, making the data difficult to analyze</li> <li>as a result of the previous point, no analysis on the nature and causes of alerts is available, making it challenging to identify recurring issues</li> <li>even in the RASFF yearly report, data is presented in the form of tables, with little aid towards an efficient visualization of the information</ul> <p class=svelte-3ocqwf>This projects seeks to address the above points by providing a more compelling, interactive visualization of RASFF notifications, backed by a completely re-formatted set of data. The project is ongoing and will possibly see new additions and improvements as time (and budget) allow.</div> <h1>How to use the data</h1> <p class=svelte-3ocqwf>When analysing the data one should keep in mind that the reported numbers are based on the raw number of notifications for products originating from a certain country, a value which is highly correlated with macro-economic indicators. In practice, this means that a higher number of notifications could merely reflect higher trade volumes, and should not necessarily be associated with a higher density of non-conformities. Any comparative analysis should therefore be approached with the utmost care.</p> <p class=svelte-3ocqwf>On the other hand, one can still use RASFF data to gain useful insight and meaningful trends e.g. hot-spots of certain contaminants, recurring issues, trends in notifications after the introduction of new legislation, indirect indicators of import/export trends (with care, see above), anomalous spikes in notifications, ...</p> <h1>Disclaimer</h1> <p class=svelte-3ocqwf>All data are property of their respective owners and can be accessed in their original form through the <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=SearchForm&cleanSearch=1">RASFF Portal</a>. <br> Visual/RASFF is a personal project with no outside support of any kind.
